    "text": "Welcome to the Messi vs. Ronaldo: Who is Better? analysis webpage!\nMy name is Amir, and I am a Year 2 NUS BBA student with a Minor in CnM. This webpage aims to settle the age-old debate on who is the superior football player: Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? This debate has captivated football fans worldwide, delving deep into sports analytics to compare two players who have been at the top of the game for years, each boasting record-breaking numbers.\nThe dataset utilized for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and contains comprehensive data on all of Messi and Ronaldo’s goals throughout their illustrious careers. Before diving into the analysis, the dataset underwent thorough cleaning processes, including filtering, grouping, summarizing, ungrouping and mutating, arranging, handling long labels and missing values.\nIn the analysis tab, you can select which player’s statistics you wish to view and generate analysis for specific categories. Additionally, I have provided insights into what each visualization suggests, helping you delve deeper into the comparison between Messi and Ronaldo.\nLet’s settle the debate once and for all—Messi or Ronaldo?

    "section": "Goals Over Seasons - Time Plot",
    "text": "Goals Over Seasons - Time Plot\nFirstly, let us analyse the time plot indicating the goals over seasons. Ronaldo has played for 25 seasons so far while Messi has played for 19. One could argue that Messi is better because his highest-scoring season is above 70 goals. Meanwhile, Ronaldo did not break that threshold, with his highest-scoring season only having around 60 goals.\nHowever, Ronaldo had 2 seasons crossing the threshold of 60 or more goals, while Messi only had one season – his highlight season of above 70 goals. Ronaldo also had 1 more season where he scored more than 50 goals, with 6 while Messi had only 5, and Ronaldo had only 5 seasons in 25 seasons where he scored less than 20 goals, while Messi had 6 seasons scoring less than 20 goals. Hence, statistically, although Messi experienced a higher performance maximum, Ronaldo can be argued to be a much more consistent, and well-performing scorer across his football career."

    "text": "Goals by Type\nSecond, from the goals by type plot, Ronaldo has scored in a larger variety of ways than Messi. Ronaldo is renowned for his dominant right foot, while Messi is well-known for being a left-footed player which is rather rare in football. Between both players, Ronaldo has scored more goals with his non-dominant left foot than Messi has with his right. Ronaldo has also scored more goals with his head than Messi. Thus, Ronaldo’s versatile proficiency as opposed to Messi adds layers of unpredictability to his goal-scoring repertoire."

    "text": "Goals By Position\nNext, we analyse the goals by position. Ronaldo has scored slightly over 200 goals from the Centre Forward (CF) position, over 350 goals from the Left Wing (LW), and nearly 100 goals from the Right Wing (RW). Meanwhile, Messi has scored over 250 goals from CF, over 200 goals from RW, and an almost negligible number of goals from LW.\nAlthough Messi’s negligibility of goals from LW may be due to playing fewer games in that position, the statistics continue to be in favour of Ronaldo as a more versatile scorer. Ronaldo has scored more goals from the sides as compared to Messi, whose goals are mainly concentrated through the middle. In football, scoring successfully from the wings requires a greater amount of tactility and skill as opposed to the middle. Despite acknowledging possible reasons behind Messi’s negligibility of goals from LW, in sum, Ronaldo still scores a greater total of goals from wing positions as opposed to Messi – another testament to his athletic capabilities."

    "text": "Goals by Minute Heatmap\nFurther, let us analyse the goal distribution by the match minute through a heatmap. Ronaldo has scored more goals than Messi after the 90th minute, the most crucial moment of any football match, thus pointing to him as a clutch scorer. As the minutes in the match drag on, players get more fatigued making it harder to score.\nWhile the fatigue builds up, so does the pressure of the game. Hence, it takes a great player who can excel under pressure to accurately score in the later stages of the game. However, aside from goals scored after the 90-minute mark, admittedly both Messi and Ronaldo have a very high percentage of goals late into the game within 90 minutes.\nThus, both can be argued to be clutch players. Regardless, this metric is tough to compare singularly between because, within 90 minutes, the goals scored bear differing significances. For example, a goal scored in a 4-1 match difference weighs significantly less than one scored as the winning goal in a 4-4 match."

    "text": "General Observations\nBefore we analyse the plots, it is always good practice to see what observations we can make from the dataset itself.\nBelow are some summary statistics about the dataset.\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Player            TotalGoals\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;int&gt;\n1 Cristiano Ronaldo        701\n2 Lionel Messi             699\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Player            AverageGoalsPerSeason\n  &lt;chr&gt;                             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Cristiano Ronaldo                  33.4\n2 Lionel Messi                       36.8\n\n\nAs one can observe from this summary, Ronaldo’s total goals tally up to 2 more than Messi’s. However, Messi has played for a lesser number of seasons, consequently meaning that he had a shorter career than Ronaldo. Also, on average, Messi has scored more goals per season than Ronaldo. Thus, on the surface and based on these statistics, it would seem conclusive that Messi is a better player. However, let us examine their respective performances more deeply within certain categories!"

Different leagues in football are accompanied by different playing styles, settings, and competitiveness. Ronaldo has played and scored in more leagues than Messi, indicating that he is a more versatile player because he can adapt and perform well despite different settings.\nFurthermore, he has played in the Premier League – the highest level of the English football league system and a highly competitive, global league – while Messi has not. Furthermore, he has more goals in the Champions League, deemed the best competition in the world. Interestingly, Ronaldo has scored a total of 60 goals across 49 Champions League games – a record that nobody else has managed to come close to in football.\nTo make this more interesting, we can zoom in to each players’ goals by their respective competitions through this app!\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAbove is a plot showing the number of wins for each player. While Ronaldo has slightly more wins, it is important to note that Messi has played fewer seasons than him. Consequently, Messi likely has a higher average win percentage than Ronaldo, despite Ronaldo having more wins."

Despite Messi’s impressive goal-scoring record, Ronaldo’s consistent performance across multiple seasons and leagues, coupled with his unmatched versatility in scoring from different positions and with various techniques, underscores his status as a dominant force in football.\nFurthermore, Ronaldo’s ability to excel under pressure, demonstrated by his propensity for scoring crucial goals, particularly in late-game situations, solidifies his reputation as a clutch player. Additionally, Ronaldo’s success in adapting to different football environments, including the highly competitive Premier League, showcases his resilience and adaptability This sets him apart as a truly exceptional athlete. While Messi’s accomplishments are undoubtedly remarkable, Ronaldo’s multifaceted skill set and enduring impact on the game position him as the stronger player in this comparison."
